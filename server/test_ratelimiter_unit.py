"""test_ratelimiter_unit.py -- fast, deterministic test of
RateLimiter._prune()'s bucket-cleanup behavior.

RateLimiter._buckets grows one entry per distinct key (source IP) ever
seen, with nothing to evict them but _prune() (see the class's own
docstring in ac_server.py). The live HTTP suite (test_server.sh)
thoroughly exercises the *rate-limiting* behavior this class provides,
but has no way to observe its *internal* memory behavior under many
distinct keys -- that's what this test is for, isolated from any server/
network/root, and fast enough (~1s) to run on every push rather than
only in the nightly stress job (see stress_test.sh for the live,
concurrent, sustained-load counterpart to this).

No unittest framework, no pytest -- matches this project's existing
test-script style (plain assert-and-report, see test_server.sh).
