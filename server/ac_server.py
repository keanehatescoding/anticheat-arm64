ac_server.py -- minimal report-ingestion + ban-lookup server for the
hypranticheat daemon's ban pipeline.

Two things this deliberately is NOT:

  - An enforcement point. This project has no game or matchmaking server
    to integrate with, so there is nothing here that kicks or blocks a
    player. GET /banned/<client_id> is the API a real game server would
    call before letting someone connect; calling it is left to that
    (nonexistent, in this project) system.

  - An auto-ban system. A report is a client-side daemon's unverified
    claim about itself -- and the daemon runs on the exact machine a
    cheat author controls, so a report can be wrong, spoofed, or replayed
    by an attacker probing for false positives. Reports only accumulate;
    a human decides whether to actually ban via POST /ban after reviewing
    GET /reports/<client_id>. Auto-banning on unverified client input
    would turn a bug or a spoofed report into a banned real player, which
    is a worse failure mode than a slower human-in-the-loop pipeline.

Storage is a single SQLite file (zero extra services to run). Auth is two
static bearer tokens: a report key (used by daemon instances, via
AC_REPORT_KEY) and an admin key (used by whoever reviews/bans/queries).
Each tier optionally accepts one additional "-old" key
(AC_SERVER_REPORT_KEY_OLD / AC_SERVER_ADMIN_KEY_OLD) for a zero-downtime
rotation window -- see --report-key-old/--admin-key-old below. There is no
built-in TLS -- run this behind a reverse proxy for anything reachable
over an untrusted network, or keep it LAN/localhost-only, which is the
deployment this was actually built and tested against.
